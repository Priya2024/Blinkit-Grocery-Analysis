## 📌 Problem Statement

BlinkIT, a fast-growing online grocery delivery platform, needed to make sense of its vast and complex transaction data to improve operational efficiency and customer experience. However, decision-makers lacked clear insights into:

- Which product categories drive the most revenue?
- How do sales fluctuate over time?
- Which regions perform best?
- How do customer segments behave?

Without data-driven visibility, the company risked inefficiencies in marketing, stock management, and customer engagement.
